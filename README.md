==============

For installed testing env was used *npm*

Two test frameworks were used: jasmine and mocha (with mocha-jsdom)

Install jasmine:
```
sudo npm install -g jasmine
```

Install mocha and mocha-jsdom:

```
sudo npm install -g mocha
sudo npm install -g mocha-jsdom
```

To run *mocha* test run the command:

If errors occurs run commands below:
```
npm install chai
npm install mocha-standard
npm install commander
